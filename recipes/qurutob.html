        <p>Qurutob, Tajikistan's national dish, is a unique and flavorful "bread salad" combining savory and refreshing elements. The final dish is served on a large communal plate, perfect for sharing. Traditionally, it's eaten with your hands, allowing you to scoop up the flavorful combination of ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Qurut: These are the star of the show! They are small, dried balls of cheese, sometimes called Tajik cheese curds.</li>
            <li>Fatir: This is a type of flatbread, key to soaking up the qurut broth. </li>
            <li>Water: Used to rehydrate the qurut and create the savory base. </li>
            <li>Onions: Sliced and often caramelized for a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Salt: Enhances the overall flavor profile.</li>
            <li>Linseed oil (optional): Adds a nutty flavor, but other neutral oils can be used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common additions (all optional):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vegetables: Tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh herbs like cilantro and parsley bring pops of color and freshness.</li>
            <li>Meat: Shredded lamb or beef can be included for a more substantial dish.</li>
            <li>Chili peppers: For those who like a touch of heat.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rehydrate the Qurut: Soak the qurut balls in water for several hours, or even overnight, depending on their size and dryness. The goal is to soften them and create a flavorful broth.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Fatir: Traditionally, fatir is a layered flatbread made in a special tandoor oven. If you can't find it, a good substitute is pita bread or another flatbread, cut into bite-sized pieces. </li> 
            <li>Saut√© the Onions: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until softened and caramelized for a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Make the Sauce: Once the onions are ready, crumble the softened qurut balls into the pan with the onions. Add the water from soaking the qurut (along with any additional water needed) and simmer for a few minutes, stirring occasionally. You want a slightly thick and flavorful sauce. </li>
            <li>Incorporate the Fatir:  Add the pieces of fatir or flatbread to the pan and toss them gently with the sauce. Let them soak up the flavors for a minute or two, but avoid overdoing it or they'll become mushy.</li>
            <li>Assemble and Serve: Transfer the mixture to a serving platter. You can arrange the soaked flatbread on the bottom and top it with the sauce and onions. </li>
            <li>Add the Finishing Touches: Here's where you can get creative! Traditionally, chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, and fresh herbs like cilantro and parsley are sprinkled on top. You can also add cooked and shredded meat for a heartier version. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>Qurutob is a communal dish, so prepare it on a large platter for sharing. It's traditionally eaten with your hands, but utensils can be offered as well.
            Adjust the amount of water in the sauce based on your desired consistency. You want it flavorful but not overly soupy. Feel free to experiment with different
            vegetables and herbs to personalize your Qurutob. </p>
